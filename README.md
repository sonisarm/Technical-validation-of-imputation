# Technical validation imputation
Author: Sonia Sarmiento

###Â This repository is a collection of resources and tools to use to assess the validity of imputation of low-coverage samples. 

## Introduction 
This repository tests the accuracy of imputation by comparing the results obtained from high-coverage and low-coverage sequencing of the same individuals. The incongruences between the two sets of data are analyzed to determine the reliability of the imputation process. This type of validation is important to ensure that the imputed data is accurate and can be used for meaningful analysis. The repository provides a comprehensive and systematic approach to evaluating the validity of imputation, making it an important resource for researchers in the field of genomics.
